# Technical Documentation: Machine Learning Pipeline

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a machine learning pipeline for natural language processing tasks.

## Architecture Components

### Data Preprocessing Module
The preprocessing module handles text normalization, tokenization, and feature extraction. Key functions include:
- `normalize_text()`: Converts text to lowercase and removes special characters
- `tokenize_document()`: Splits text into semantic units
- `extract_features()`: Generates numerical representations

### Model Training Pipeline
The training pipeline consists of multiple stages:
1. Data validation and cleaning
2. Feature engineering and selection
3. Model training with cross-validation
4. Performance evaluation and metrics calculation

### Inference Engine
The inference engine provides real-time predictions:
- Load trained model artifacts
- Process incoming requests
- Return predictions with confidence scores
- Handle batch and streaming inference

## Configuration Parameters
```yaml
model:
  type: "transformer"
  layers: 12
  hidden_size: 768
  vocab_size: 30000

training:
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 2e-5
  epochs: 10
  warmup_steps: 1000
```

## Performance Metrics
The system achieves the following performance benchmarks:
- Accuracy: 94.2%
- Precision: 93.8%
- Recall: 94.6%
- F1-Score: 94.2%
- Inference latency: 15ms (p95)

## Deployment Considerations
When deploying to production:
- Ensure adequate computational resources
- Monitor model drift and performance degradation
- Implement proper logging and alerting
- Plan for model versioning and rollback procedures
