# Sample Document for RAG Testing

## Introduction
This is a sample document created for testing the Local RAG WebApp functionality. This document contains various types of content to test the parsing, chunking, and retrieval capabilities.

## Technical Overview
The Local RAG WebApp is designed to process documents locally without sending data to external services. It uses:

1. **Document Processing**: Parses PDF, TXT, and other formats
2. **Adaptive Chunking**: Automatically determines optimal chunk sizes
3. **Local Embeddings**: Uses sentence-transformers models
4. **Vector Storage**: Qdrant for similarity search
5. **Language Model**: Local LLM for answer generation

## Features
- Document upload and management
- Real-time chat interface  
- Citation tracking and source references
- Performance monitoring
- Local-only operation for privacy

## Test Scenarios
This document should be processed through the following pipeline:
1. Upload via the web interface
2. Parse text content
3. Apply adaptive chunking algorithm
4. Generate embeddings using local model
5. Index vectors in Qdrant
6. Enable retrieval for Q&A

## Conclusion
This sample document provides sufficient content to test the core RAG functionality including document ingestion, processing, and retrieval capabilities.
