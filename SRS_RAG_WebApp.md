# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for RAG-based Local Web Application

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based web application that enables users to upload and query documents (PDFs, books, text files, etc.) entirely on a local environment. The system ensures privacy, efficiency, and accuracy, while operating within the hardware and software constraints of a standard laptop.

### 1.2 Scope
The system will allow users to:
- Upload and manage multiple documents (PDFs, text, books).
- Automatically preprocess documents (chunking, embedding, indexing).
- Perform queries using a locally running LLM with RAG pipeline.
- Retrieve accurate and contextually relevant results.
- View and interact with responses in a chat-based UI with query-response history.
- Automatically optimize chunk size and number of chunks based on the source document.

The solution must operate locally, using a flexible vector database, and be resource-efficient to avoid overwhelming the laptop’s CPU and RAM.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The system is a standalone desktop-hosted web application. It integrates:
- Local LLM for query interpretation and response generation.
- Vector database for document embedding and retrieval (e.g., FAISS or Chroma).
- Document manager for upload, indexing, and retrieval lifecycle.
- Interactive chat interface with streaming responses and history.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Document Upload & Management
- Automatic Preprocessing (chunking, embedding, indexing)
- Adaptive Chunking (auto-tuning chunk size/number)
- Local Query Execution (LLM + RAG)
- Accurate Information Retrieval
- Chat-Based User Interface with Streaming and History
- System Performance Configuration

### 2.3 User Characteristics
- Primary Users: Students, researchers, professionals, and personal users seeking a private knowledge assistant.
- No advanced technical knowledge required.
- Expected to interact through a browser interface.

### 2.4 Constraints
- Must run locally without external API calls.
- Optimized for standard laptops (e.g., 8–16 GB RAM, no dedicated GPU).
- Privacy and security preserved (no cloud processing).

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users will upload documents in supported formats (PDF, TXT, EPUB).
- Laptop hardware provides minimum resources for LLM inference and indexing.
- Open-source libraries (LangChain, FAISS/Chroma, HuggingFace models) are available.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Document Upload & Management
- **FR-01:** Users can upload one or multiple documents.
- **FR-02:** Uploaded documents are listed in a document manager with metadata (name, size, date added).
- **FR-03:** Users can delete, update, or reindex documents.

### 3.2 Preprocessing & Indexing
- **FR-04:** The system shall chunk uploaded documents automatically.
- **FR-05:** The system shall embed chunks into a vector space using a local embedding model.
- **FR-06:** The system shall store embeddings in a vector database.
- **FR-07:** The system shall automatically adjust chunk size and number of chunks based on document type and length.

### 3.3 Query Handling
- **FR-08:** Users can input natural language queries in a chat window.
- **FR-09:** The system shall retrieve relevant document chunks using vector similarity search.
- **FR-10:** The system shall generate responses using a local LLM integrated with retrieved context.
- **FR-11:** Responses shall be streamed in real-time.

### 3.4 Chat Interface
- **FR-12:** The chat panel shall display user queries and system responses in sequence.
- **FR-13:** Users can scroll through previous queries and responses.
- **FR-14:** The system shall retain conversational context within a session to allow for follow-up questions.
- **FR-15:** The system shall provide a user action (e.g., a "Clear Context" button) to reset the conversational history.

### 3.5 System Configuration
- **FR-16:** The system shall provide selectable performance profiles (e.g., Eco, Balanced, Performance) to manage CPU and RAM usage.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- **NFR-01:** The time-to-first-token for a query response shall be less than 1.5 seconds on target hardware (p95).
- **NFR-02:** A 500-token response shall be fully streamed in under 8 seconds on target hardware.
- **NFR-03:** Resource usage shall be optimized to prevent laptop freezing or crashes, corresponding to the selected performance profile (FR-16).

### 4.2 Reliability
- **NFR-04:** The system shall handle corrupted or unsupported file uploads gracefully.
- **NFR-05:** Indexing errors shall be logged, and failed documents flagged in the UI.

### 4.3 Usability
- **NFR-06:** The user interface shall be intuitive, minimalistic, and user-friendly.
- **NFR-07:** The system shall stream LLM responses to improve user experience.

### 4.4 Portability
- **NFR-08:** The application shall run locally on Windows, macOS, and Linux laptops with minimal setup.

### 4.5 Security
- **NFR-09:** No document or query data shall leave the user’s machine.
- **NFR-10:** Data shall be stored locally with basic encryption options.
